## Resume

While studying at the university, I took part in the competition for the best layout of the site. This topic interested me and, since the university program seemed to me insufficient, I decided to deepen my knowledge on this issue. As a result, my project took first place. I was so carried away by the process of website development that I decided to continue self-study. Now I realized that i can not only work, but do what i love. Every day I improve my knowledge in the field of frontend development. My goal is to become a full **Full stack** developer and develop the coolest projects that make our world better.
